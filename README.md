## Architecture Overview

### Web Server (WebServer.cpp)
- Serves static files and manages API endpoints:
  - `/api/sensors`: Lists sensors and temperature readings.
  - `/api/relays`: Controls and reports relay status.
  - `/api/status`: Returns system health and diagnostics.

- Built on AsyncTCP and AsyncWebServer libraries for efficient, non-blocking I/O.

### OneWire Manager (OneWireManager.cpp)
- Manages DS18B20 temperature sensors:
  - Scans, maintains, and updates a dynamic sensor list.
  - Provides thread-safe access to sensor data using FreeRTOS mutexes.
- Exposes API methods like `getSensorList()` for other modules.


# Data Flow

1. Sensor Data Collection
	â€¢	The OneWireManager scans for connected sensors using sensors.getDeviceCount() and sensors.getAddress().
	â€¢	Temperature readings are requested using sensors.requestTemperaturesByAddress() and read via sensors.getTempC().
	â€¢	The sensor list and readings are stored in a thread-safe data structure (sensorList), guarded by a FreeRTOS mutex.

2. API Requests
	â€¢	A client sends an HTTP GET request to an API endpoint (e.g., /api/sensors).
	â€¢	The web server calls the getSensorList() method from OneWireManager.
	â€¢	Sensor data is serialized into JSON using ArduinoJson and sent back to the client.

3. Static File Serving
	â€¢	The root path (/) serves static files (e.g., a front-end dashboard) from the SPIFFS filesystem.

## Web API Reference

The SensorHub exposes several RESTful APIs for interacting with the system. All APIs use JSON for request and response payloads.

### Authentication

All API endpoints except `/login` require a valid JWT token obtained through authentication. 
The token should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Endpoints

## Setup

1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - ESP32 microcontroller with a OneWire-compatible pin.
     The Olimex ESP32 EVB board is a perfect solution, pin4 of the UEXT connector can be used for OneWire.
   - DS18B20 temperature sensors on a OneWire bus.
   - Pull-up resistor for proper operation.

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
   - Libraries:
     - AsyncTCP
     - ESPAsyncWebServer
     - ArduinoJson

3. **Configuration**:
   - Update `Config.h` with the correct pin numbers and timeouts.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Flash the firmware to the device.
   - Access the web interface via the device's IP address.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sensors Detected
- Verify sensors are correctly connected to the OneWire bus.
- Ensure the pull-up resistor is properly installed.

### API Returns 0 Sensors
- Check logs for errors like "Failed to take mutex."
- Increase the mutex timeout in `OneWireManager.cpp`.

### `_poll(): pcb is NULL`
- Ensure connections are properly closed after handling requests.
- Reduce the number of simultaneous client connections.

### Debugging Tips
- Enable verbose logging in the Logger module.
- Monitor system load and network traffic to identify bottlenecks.

## Future Improvements
- Preferences pages auto refresh disable, it hinders filling the form.
- Implement asynchronous temperature conversion to reduce blocking.
- Add support for additional sensor types.
- Optimize memory usage for larger sensor arrays.

## MQTT structure

SensorHub implements a sophisticated dual-protocol MQTT architecture that simultaneously supports both ThingsBoard and Home Assistant MQTT patterns. This enables seamless integration with multiple IoT platforms while maintaining efficient communication.

### Home Assistant Integration

The system implements Home Assistant's MQTT Discovery protocol, enabling automatic device configuration:

```
homeassistant/
â”œâ”€â”€ sensor/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sensorhub_device1_sensor1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config           (discovery configuration)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ state           (current temperature)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ attributes      (metadata, status, names)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sensorhub_device1_babelsensor/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ state
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ attributes
â””â”€â”€ switch/
    â””â”€â”€ sensorhub_device1_relay1/
        â”œâ”€â”€ config
        â”œâ”€â”€ state           (ON/OFF)
        â”œâ”€â”€ set            (control topic)
        â””â”€â”€ attributes
```

### ThingsBoard Integration

ThingsBoard telemetry is handled through efficient batched JSON payloads:

```
v1/devices/me/
â”œâ”€â”€ telemetry        (batched sensor data)
â””â”€â”€ attributes       (device metadata)
```

### Key Features

- **Auto-Discovery**: Devices automatically appear in Home Assistant with proper names, icons, and capabilities
- **Efficient Batching**: Sensor data is batched into single JSON payloads for ThingsBoard
- **Dual Protocol**: Simultaneously publishes to both platforms without redundancy
- **Persistent Topics**: Uses retained messages for reliable state recovery
- **Rich Metadata**: Includes detailed device information and attributes
- **Command Support**: Handles relay control commands from both platforms

### Special Features

#### BabelSensor Virtual Device

The BabelSensor feature allows dynamic remapping of any physical sensor to a virtual sensor endpoint. This enables:
- Remote displays to follow any selected sensor
- Flexible sensor routing without physical rewiring
- Integration with projects like the remote_NTP_clock_display_for_sensorHUB

On the preferences page is a selector to send one of the sensors data ta a virtual sensor.
This allows for other devices to follow this sensor. The virtual sensor is named: BabelSensor.
Another relatad project: remote_NTP_clock_display_for_sensorHUB looks for this sensor and displays it's value.
(https://github.com/MYBLtd/remote_NTP_clock_display_for_sensorHUB)
 
The project defined some alias names for use cases like this:
- The Babel Sensor â€“ Magically translates whatever sensor the user selects.
- SensaThingâ„¢ â€“ Vaguely important. Doesâ€¦ something. The marketing team is still working on it.

Some more for your own project:
- SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s Sensor â€“ You donâ€™t know what itâ€™s showing until you subscribe. I guess 
  this is a nice one to code ;-) 
- The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Telemetry â€“ Now with 100% less panic.
- The Pan-Galactic Data Blaster â€“ Packs a punch, best enjoyed with a towel in hand.
- The Infinite Improbability Feed â€“ Somehow always displays the right sensor, against all logic.

Current version: `1.3.2`
